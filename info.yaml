--- # assignment constraints and their practical use
third person POV: first person POV is unconvenient / 3rd person POV provides smth worthy to look at
shooter: everyone has some sort of gun and can shoot each other
attacks: both player and enemies can do short-range (projectile spawn) and long-range (raycasting) attacks
destructable game-changing actors: they crumble away and do something significant (maybe limited by timer)
sensible enemy actions: efficient and intimidating
# 40%
4. OnActorHit, OnComponentHit:
5. enemy behaviour tree & blackboard:
6. GameMode with rules, scores...:
7. sound:
# 50%
9. ViewAnywhere/EditAnywhere:
10. widgets with player info: hp? cooldown?
12. UGameplayStatics::ApplyDamage:
13. UProjectileComponent:
  'player can do at least 2 types of attacks: spawn projectile (must deal damage) / raycast'
  what each does? different tactical use - not just for damage
14. c++ timer:
  game session time? i dont want to encourage speedrun pressure
  the more time passes, the crazier environment gets?
  some platforms/triggers/cooldowns?
15. OnActionBeginOverlap, OnComponentBeginOverlap:
# 60%
18. physics Impulse, Radial.., Force:
19. AIPlayerController:
20. pathfinding of any sort
21. same as 5.:
# 70%
25. c++
